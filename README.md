Developed a Todo app with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The application utilizes SQLite as the database, where tasks can be added, updated, and deleted dynamically. Implemented a structured database model with SQLAlchemy ORM, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. The app features a user-friendly Bootstrap-based UI for seamless interaction, with form validation and real-time updates. The SQLite database (.db file) stores task details, including titles, descriptions, and timestamps, ensuring persistence across sessions.
